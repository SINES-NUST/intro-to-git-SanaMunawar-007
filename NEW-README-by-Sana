<br>
**The Death of Socrates** (_French: La Mort de Socrates_) is an oil on canvas painted by French painter **Jacques-Louis David** in 1787. 
<br>
The painting was part of the neoclassical style, popular in the 1780s, that depicted subjects from the Classical age, in this case the story of the execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his _Phaedo_. 
<br>
In this story, Socrates has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods, and has been sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock.
<br>
Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. 
<br>
The _Phaedo_ depicts the death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final days, which is also detailed in the _Euthyphro_, _Apology_, and _Crito_.
